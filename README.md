Customer Satisfaction is the prime most Importance of any Business to prosper. Customer Satisfaction can help in selling product to prospective buyer. 
Santander Customer Transaction Prediction is Kaggle Competition to determine which customer can be translated to a buyer.
In this competition we are asked to predict if a customer will make a transaction or not regardless of the amount of money transacted. Hence our goal is to solve a binary classification problem. In the data description you can see that the features given are numeric and anonymized. Furthermore the data seems to be artificial as they state that "the data has the same structure as our real data"
In my project,We will explore the data,Analyze it, Make predictions based on Data Visualisation and train a model and predict the outcome on Test Data
